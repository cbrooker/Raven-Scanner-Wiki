# Raven Scanner Wiki


Raven Scanner is going out of business and their cloud services, which are required for the device to operate, will be shutting down 12/31/2023. 

In an attempt to continue using the hardware I paid for I'm embarking on a journey to reverse engineer as much of their software as I can to hopefully get to a point where we can have a community run API.
